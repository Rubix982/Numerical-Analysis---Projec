/*
*   NEWTON CENTRAL DIFFERENCE FOMRULA 3.12
*
*   The Newton forward- and backward-difference formulas are not appropriate
*   for approximating f (x) when x lies near the center of the table because
*   neither will permit the highest-order difference to have x0 close to x.
*   A number of divided-difference formulas are available for this case, each
*   of which has situations when it can be used to maximum advantage. These
*   methods are known as centered-difference formulas. We will consider only
*   one centereddifference formula, Stirling’s method.
*
*   For the centered-difference formulas, we choose x0 near the point being
*   approximated and label the nodes directly below x0 as x1, x2, ...
*   and those directly above as x−1, x−2, ... .
*
*   f on the interval [a,b], where f(a) and f(b) have
*   opposite signs:
*
*   INPUT:   ?
*
*
*   OUTPUT:  ?
