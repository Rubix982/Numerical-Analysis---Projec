/*
*   LAGRANGE EQUATION
*
*   The problem of determining a polynomial of degree one that passes through
*   the distinct points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is the same as approximating a
*   function f for which f (x0) = y0 and f (x1) = y1 by means of a first-degree
*   polynomial interpolating, or agreeing with, the values of f at the given
*   points. Using this polynomial for approximation within the interval given
*   by the endpoints is called polynomial interpolation.*
*
*   Define the functions
*       L0(x) = (x − x1)/(x0 − x1)  and L1(x) = (x − x0)/(x1 − x0)
